The **Daily Ranger DE40 Balanced** is expertly designed to harness the dynamic intraday price action behaviour of Germany's top blue-chip index, the DE40, also known as DAX, GER40, DE30 or GER30. Our trading strategy capitalises on the high liquidity and predicable volatility cycles unique to DE40's most active trading hours, offering a genuine trading edge.
