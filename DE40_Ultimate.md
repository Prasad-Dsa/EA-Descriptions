The EA is engineered to target optimal intraday entry and exit points, providing a reliable advantage that can be compounded over a long term for the ultimate returns and maximum profitability.

> NO GRIDS, NO MARTINGALE, NO ADDING TO LOSERS

We rigorously test our EAs with real tick data, which is the most accurate way to test an EA and closely mimic real live trading conditions. We do not use interpolated ticks which mislead and give vastly different results with real ticks.

Our Ultimate series is developed to unleash the full profit potential of our strategy. Choose your preferred Risk Per Trade and let our EA do the rest.
