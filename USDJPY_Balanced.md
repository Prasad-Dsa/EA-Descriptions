> NO GRIDS, NO MARTINGALE, NO ADDING TO LOSERS

Our EA is rigorously testing using real tick data, the most accurate way of testing an EA, mimicking real life trading conditions the closest, providing a realistic and reliable performance evaluation. We do not use ideal interpolated ticks that give vastly different results when working with real ticks.

Experience our revolutionary approach to intraday trading with our Balanced series, meticulously crafted for traders seeking a balanced portfolio growth with consistent returns and lower drawdowns. Select your Risk Per Trade and let our EA do the rest.
