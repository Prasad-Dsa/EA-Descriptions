# USDJPY Ultimate

The **Daily Ranger USDJPY Ultimate** is crafted to unleash the full intraday trading potential of USDJPY, one of the most liquid forex pairs in the world, leveraging its unique price action and volatility surges. Our strategy is fine-tuned to capitalise on USDJPY's most dynamic market movements, volatility cycles and liquidity driven trends during both London and New York dual-session peak activity trading hours. Our algorithm is engineered to target optimal intraday entry and exit points, with a focus on high-growth potential, providing a reliable advantage that can be compounded over a long term for the ultimate returns and maximum profitability.

We pride ourselves in our ability to offer a pure trading edge that genuinely exploits the market's intraday structure.

> NO GRID, NO MARTINGALE, NO ADDING TO LOSERS

We rigorously test our EAs with real tick data, which is the most accurate way to test an EA and closely mimic real-life trading conditions. We do not use interpolated ticks which mislead and give vastly different results with real ticks.

Our Ultimate series is developed to unleash the full profit potential of our strategy. Choose your preferred Risk Per Trade and watch our EA navigate the liquid and dynamic price environment of USDJPY.
