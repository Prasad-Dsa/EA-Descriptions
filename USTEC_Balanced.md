# Daily Ranger USTEC Balanced
The **Daily Ranger USTEC Balanced** is expertly designed to unlock the true trading potential of Nasdaq's dynamic intraday price action behaviour during its most liquid trading hours. Known as USTEC, NAS100, US100, NQ100, the Nasdaq index represents a highly liquid and tech-driven market that sees distinct volatility cycles and liquidity surges. Our trading algorithm is carefully engineered to identify key intraday entry and exit points on the basis of these factors, providing a reliable advantage that can be compounded over a long term for consistent returns.

Unlike other EAs, our approach stands apart by offering a genuine old school trading edge

> NO GRIDS, NO MARTINGALE, NO ADDING TO LOSERS

Our EA is rigorously tested with real tick data, the most accurate way to test an EA and mimic real life trading conditions, providing a realistic and reliable performance evaluation. We do not use ideal interpolated ticks that give vastly different results when working with real ticks.

Experience a revolutionary trading edge with our Balanced series, meticulously crafted for traders seeking stable returns with lower drawdowns, providing a balanced approach to portfolio growth. Simply choose your Percentage Risk Per Trade and let our EA do the rest.
